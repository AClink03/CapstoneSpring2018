# CapstoneSpring2018
Capstone Project - SDLC and Indie Game Development

This is the final, as-is, turn in for the Spring 2018 Capstone Project at Minot State University as part of the Bachelors of Computer Science - Software Engineering education track. The Project Game Development and the SDLC process, writing and developing a process to make a video game. The video game portion was done with LibTCOD in C++, and may not build properly without the proper libraries. Development was done in Visual Studio 2017.
This was my first attempt at game development, please be nice.
